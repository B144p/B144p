### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± I'm complete Bachelor Degree on Major : 'Control Engineering' from KMITL.

But now, I want switch to 'Developer'. First, I started as a 'Web Developer'.

In additional, I'm pretty interested in 'Automate Bot'. Because some work have fixed pattern, and I feel like It's waste my relax time. ðŸ˜„

That's cause why I interested to learn Bot.

You can visit on my portfolio [Here](https://bt144p-portfolio.vercel.app/).

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Finally, all of my information skills are just at a basic level. I still need to learn and gain more experience.
